# DBT Diary Card (Xamarin.Forms app)
### ðŸ“±ðŸŒ± Forget about printable diary cards!
My first experience in mobile developing. I hope people who go through DBT therapy will find this app usefull :)


## Tools
- Visual Studio 2022
- Xamarin Forms
- [OxyPlot](https://github.com/oxyplot/oxyplot)
- Prism
- SQLite
- Paint tool SAI 2 (app icon)

## Features
The main idea of the DBT Diary Card app is to make diarize easier.
Here you can note your mood, emotions, urges and used skills. If you add 2+ entries, you will be able to see charts represent your state.
Unfortunately this app is only for andriod users (bc I don't have any Aplle products) 

**Application avalable in 2 languages:** Russian and English. You can't change it by yourself though.
