## Features
The main idea of the DBT Diary Card app is to make diarize easier.
Here you can note your mood, emotions, urges and used skills. If you add 2+ entries, you will be able to see charts represent your state.
Unfortunately this app is only for andriod users (bc I don't have any Aplle products)
