## Features
The main idea of the DBT Diary Card app is to make diarize easier.
- Daily note your mood, emotions, urges and used skills
- Edit or delete your entries
- Add 2+ entries and check out charts that represent your state
- Show your psychoterapist table for 1-2 weeks of your diary (looks exactly the same as printable DBT diary card)
- Localization (eng/rus)
